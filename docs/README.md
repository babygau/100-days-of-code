my goal
=======

a new year is just around the corner and it will be very significant to my life and my family. i'm feeling so excited yet intimidated to the challenges I set out in new year, and this **\#100daysofcode** is one of them that i want to complete. however, i also want to emphasis that i'm no way a professional developer, i'm doing this purefly because it's my passion. therefore, i'm not looking into doing something that could give you any **wow** or **awe** moment. here is what i hope to gain through the challenge

-   step \#1: build my first ever blog, up and running i will use `hakyll` as a static blog generator. the reason will be explained in next step the ui will be pretty much a copy cat from default template, because i have zero experience with `haskell` for now
-   step \#2: learning `haskell` through `haskell book`, i've been falling in love with this book since day one i bought it but haven't managed the time to learn it by now you would know that i will start the challenge with `haskell` because i'm so curious about functional programming language, about `monad` and everything in between. this will also help me equip knowledge to learn about `typescript` which is also a strong static typing language
-   step \#3: re-evaluate my blog by the time i complete the book, i believe i will be confident enough to play with `hakyll` in deep, yet it's time to dust of my outdate `css3` skill. i will use `postcss` for my blog style
-   step \#4: start learning trio `typescript+react+redux` through `egghead.io`
-   step \#5 and final: build a website using everything i would have learned through challenge

my logs

day \#1: 07/01/2017
-------------------

**what i have done?**

-   set up my workflow for the challenge
    -   set up `emacs` workspace and packages
    -   initiate the blog using `hakyll`
-   finished chapter 1 of `haskell book`
    -   no coding task in this chapter
    -   learned about lambda/abstraction function terms \* lambda structure: head and body \* *alpha equivalence* \* *beta reduction* \* free variable \* multiple argument \* *combinator*: a lambda with no free variables \* *divergence* or *omega*: reduction process never terminates or end (infinite loop)
    -   completed chapter 1 exercises

**lesson learned?**

-   to tame `spacemacs` layout and workspace
-   to have the foundation of `haskell` lambda/function.
